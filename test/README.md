# Testing
In order to test this solution, get an access key to the [DEAP Database](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html)
and extract the preprocessed python data into this directory. Then, run the `prepare-data.py` with 
python 3 (making sure that you have `pandas` installed). Finally, run the supplied `test.js` file
and wait for the testing to finish!
